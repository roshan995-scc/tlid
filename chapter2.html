        <h1 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 2: A Flicker of Kindness </h1>
        <p class="chapter-text"> It was the day of Maha Ashtami, the most auspicious day of the festival. Meera hadn’t sold a single diya. People were too busy, too absorbed in their own joy, to notice the girl standing in the shadows.

            The evening air was heavy with incense and the scent of bhog. Hungry, Meera sat down at the edge of the road, clutching her unsold lamps. She lit one diya, its small flame casting a warm glow on her face. For a moment, she let herself imagine her mother’s comforting voice, the softness of her father’s hands as he had always placed a flower behind her ear during the festival. But those were dreams she no longer allowed herself to believe in.
            
            As the night deepened, a group of well-dressed children passed by, laughing and playing. One of them, a girl with sparkling earrings, noticed Meera. She tugged at her father’s arm, pointing toward her. The man, middle-aged and wealthy, glanced at Meera, his eyes meeting hers for just a moment. He smiled but turned away.
            
            "Papa, buy her lamps!" the little girl insisted.
            
            The man hesitated, then reached into his pocket. He handed Meera a few coins, more than she would have made in a week, and took a handful of diyas.
            
            “Keep the change,” he said kindly, his voice soft. “You’ll need it more than I do.”
            
            It was a small act of kindness, but to Meera, it felt like a light piercing through her darkness. She bowed her head in gratitude, the flame of the small diya flickering at her feet. For a moment, the world felt less lonely.<br><BR></p>
