        <p class="chapter-text">Kolkata was ablaze with the glow of a thousand lights. The streets were lined with people, moving in droves from one pandal to the next, their faces illuminated by the giant clay idols of Maa Durga, surrounded by flowers and offerings. The air buzzed with laughter, drumbeats, and chants as the city celebrated Durga Puja, the grand festival of joy, strength, and the triumph of good over evil.

            But amidst the sea of smiles and festivities, there was a girl named Meera, whose world was much quieter, much colder. Dressed in an old, threadbare saree, she stood at a corner of a bustling street with a tray of tiny clay lamps—diyas—in her hands. She was barely fifteen, her eyes reflecting the glow of the city she could never fully belong to.
            
            Meera’s mother had passed away the previous year during the last Durga Puja, and her father had succumbed to a long illness months later. Since then, she had been alone, selling clay lamps and flowers during festivals to survive. She watched families with their children, laughter on their lips, moving between the pandals, their arms loaded with sweets, gifts, and happiness. She couldn’t help but feel the crushing weight of her isolation.
            
            But she smiled anyway. It was Durga Puja, and she had always loved this time of year .<BR><BR></p>
