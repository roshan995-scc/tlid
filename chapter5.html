        <p class="chapter-text">As the days passed, Meera continued to sell her clay lamps. But something had changed. She no longer felt invisible. The little girl with the sparkling earrings returned, this time bringing her friends to buy lamps from Meera. More and more people began to notice her, not just as a seller of lamps, but as a part of the city’s soul.

            With each passing day, the kindness she had once received began to return to her in small, unexpected ways. A shopkeeper gave her extra rice. A woman in a sari offered her a blanket for the cold nights ahead. Meera, once alone and forgotten, had become a quiet symbol of resilience, of hope, and of the light that never fades, even in the darkest times.
            
            Durga Puja ended, but the spirit of the festival—the spirit of love, kindness, and humanity—remained. And so did Meera, with her tray of clay lamps, her heart now full of the light she had long been searching for.<BR><BR></p>
