        <h1 class="chapter-heading">Chapter 4: The warmth of Maa Durga</h1>
        <p class="chapter-text">That night, the city fell into a deep slumber, the kind that only comes after days of festivity and celebration. Meera, too, found herself curling up on a cold pavement, her tired body aching for rest. She hadn’t found a safe place to sleep, but she was too weary to care.

            In her dreams, Maa came to her.
            
            Maa Durga, with her ten arms and fierce, protective gaze, appeared not as the grand idol Meera had seen in the pandals, but as a gentle figure, wrapped in warmth. She knelt beside Meera and placed a soft hand on her cheek.
            
            “My child,”  Maa Durga whispered, “you are never alone.”
            
            In that moment, Meera felt a surge of peace wash over her. She felt the presence of her mother, her father, and all the love she had lost. It was as if the city itself had wrapped its arms around her, holding her in a quiet embrace.
            
            When Meera awoke, the sun was rising. The city was still asleep, but there was a lightness in her heart she hadn’t felt in a long time. She stood, looking out over the river where the goddess’s idols had been immersed the night before. The streets were empty, but in the silence, Meera didn’t feel alone.
            
            She had nothing, but she had everything she needed.<BR><BR>
