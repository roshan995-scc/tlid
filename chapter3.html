        <p class="chapter-text">As the days passed, the celebrations grew louder, but Meera’s heart remained heavy. The coins she had earned were enough to buy some rice and a bit of dal, but nothing could fill the emptiness she felt as she wandered through the city alone.

            On the night of Vijaya Dashami, when Maa Durga’s idols would be immersed in the river, Meera found herself at the banks of the Hooghly. The grand procession moved through the streets, the drumming echoing like a heartbeat through the night. Families followed the idols, their faces lit with hope and reverence, bidding farewell to the goddess.
            
            Meera stood by the water, clutching a single clay diya. She had no family to immerse her own sorrow, no mother’s arms to return to, no father’s comforting words to guide her. But in that moment, as she lit the small lamp and placed it gently on the water, she whispered a prayer.
            
            Not for herself, but for all the people who had walked past her without seeing her. For the man who had given her coins, and for the little girl who had noticed her when no one else had. For the families around her, full of life, of joy, and love. Her prayer was simple: that they would never know the loneliness she carried in her heart.
            
            The diya floated gently on the river’s surface, its light growing smaller as it drifted away, until it became just a distant glow.
